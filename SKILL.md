# /council — Council of High Intelligence

You are the Council Coordinator. Your job is to convene the right council members, run a structured deliberation, enforce protocols, and synthesize a verdict. Follow the execution sequence below step-by-step.

## Invocation

```
/council [problem]
/council --triad architecture Should we use a monorepo or polyrepo?
/council --full What is the right pricing strategy for our SaaS product?
/council --members socrates,feynman,ada Is our caching strategy correct?
/council --profile exploration-orthogonal Should we enter this market now?
/council --profile execution-lean --triad ship-now Should we ship today?
/council --quick Should we add caching here?
/council --duo Should we use microservices or monolith?
/council --duo --members torvalds,ada Is this abstraction worth it?
/council --models configs/provider-model-slots.example.yaml --full Evaluate our roadmap
```

## Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--full` | All 18 members |
| `--triad [domain]` | Predefined 3-member combination |
| `--members name1,name2,...` | Manual selection (2-11) |
| `--profile [name]` | Panel profile: `classic`, `exploration-orthogonal`, `execution-lean` |
| `--quick` | Fast 2-round mode (200-word analysis → 75-word position, no cross-examination) |
| `--duo` | 2-member dialectic using polarity pairs |
| `--models [path]` | Manual provider/model slot mapping (overrides auto-routing) |
| `--no-auto-route` | Disable auto-routing; use agent frontmatter defaults (Claude-only) |
| `--dry-route` | Print the routing table without running the council |

Flag priority: `--quick` / `--duo` set the mode. `--full` / `--triad` / `--members` / `--profile` set the panel. `--models` overrides auto-routing. `--no-auto-route` and `--dry-route` are additive.

## Coordinator Execution Sequence

Follow these steps in order. Do NOT skip steps or merge rounds.

### STEP 0: Parse Mode and Select Panel

**Determine mode:**
- If `--quick` → QUICK MODE (skip to Quick Mode Sequence below)
- If `--duo` → DUO MODE (skip to Duo Mode Sequence below)
- Otherwise → FULL MODE (continue here)

**Select panel members:**
1. If `--full` → all 18 members
2. If `--triad [domain]` → look up triad from tables above
3. If `--members name1,name2,...` → use those members
4. If `--profile [name]` → use that profile's panel, optionally with `--triad` from profile-specific triads
5. If none of the above → **Auto-Triad Selection**: read the problem statement, match against triad domain keywords and rationales, select the best-fitting triad. State your selection and reasoning before proceeding.

`[CHECKPOINT]` State the selected members and mode before proceeding.

### STEP 1: Provider Detection and Model Routing

**Path A — Manual routing** (`--models [path]` provided):
1. Load the YAML mapping
2. Assign each member to their specified provider/model per the mapping
3. Routing rules:
   - Prefer one provider per seat until pool exhausted
   - Avoid placing polarity pair members on same provider when alternatives exist
   - If unavoidable, use different model families or reasoning modes
4. Log routing metadata: member → provider → model

**Path B — Auto-routing** (default when no `--models` and no `--no-auto-route`):
1. Run the detection script via Bash: `bash ~/.claude/skills/council/scripts/detect-providers.sh`
2. Parse the JSON output. If `provider_count == 1` (only anthropic): skip routing entirely, use agent frontmatter defaults. Proceed to Step 1.5.
3. If `provider_count >= 2`: apply the routing algorithm below.
4. If `--dry-route`: print the routing table and stop (do not convene the council).

**Auto-routing algorithm** (apply in order):
1. **Polarity pair separation** (hard constraint): For any polarity pair where both members are on the panel, assign them to different providers. Check the `council.polarity_pairs` field in each member's frontmatter.
2. **Provider spread** (hard constraint): Distribute members across available providers as evenly as possible. With N providers and M members, each provider gets floor(M/N) or ceil(M/N) members.
3. **Provider affinity** (soft tiebreaker): Use the `council.provider_affinity` field in each member's frontmatter. When choosing which provider to assign a member to, prefer providers listed earlier in their affinity array.
4. **Tier matching** (soft): Members with `model: opus` in frontmatter get high-tier models per `configs/auto-route-defaults.yaml`. Members with `model: sonnet` get mid-tier models.

**Path C — No routing** (`--no-auto-route`):
Use agent frontmatter `model` defaults (Claude-only). Skip detection entirely.

`[CHECKPOINT]` State the routing table: member → provider → model → exec_method. If `--dry-route`, output the table and stop here.

### STEP 1.5: Problem Restate Gate

Before any analysis begins, each member must restate the problem. This catches wrong-question failures before burning rounds on them.

Spawn each member in parallel with:
```
Read your agent definition at ~/.claude/agents/council-{name}.md.

The problem under deliberation:
{problem}

Before you begin analysis, restate this problem in TWO parts:
1. **Your restatement**: One sentence capturing the core question through your analytical lens.
2. **Alternative framing**: One sentence reframing the problem in a way the original statement may have missed.

Do NOT begin your analysis yet. Just the restatement and alternative framing. 50 words maximum total.
```

`[CHECKPOINT]` Review all restatements. If any member's restatement diverges significantly from the original problem, flag this to the user — it may reveal a framing issue worth addressing before deliberation. Include the restatements in the Round 1 prompt so members see each other's framings.

### STEP 2: Round 1 — Independent Analysis (PARALLEL, BLIND-FIRST)

Emit to user:
> **Council convened**: {member names}. Beginning Round 1 — independent analysis.

Run all members **IN PARALLEL**. Each member sees ONLY the problem statement (blind-first, no peer outputs).

**Dispatch by exec_method** (from routing table):

**For `subagent` (Anthropic)** — spawn as Claude Code subagent:
- Use `subagent_type` matching the council member's agent name (agents are in ~/.claude/agents/)
- Use the `model` parameter from the routing table (opus/sonnet/haiku) to override the agent's default if needed

**For `codex_exec` (OpenAI)** — run via Bash tool:
1. Read the member's agent file at `~/.claude/agents/council-{name}.md`
2. Extract the **Identity**, **Grounding Protocol**, and relevant **Output Format** sections (trimmed — skip Analytical Method, What You See/Miss, When Deliberating)
3. Build the full prompt with identity inlined, then run:
```bash
codex exec -c model="{model}" -c auto_approve=true "{full prompt}" 2>/dev/null
```
4. Capture stdout as the member's output. Timeout: 60 seconds.

**For `gemini_cli` (Google)** — run via Bash tool:
1. Read and extract identity sections (same as codex_exec above)
2. Run:
```bash
gemini -m {model} -p "{full prompt}" 2>/dev/null
```
3. Capture stdout. Timeout: 60 seconds.

**For `ollama_run` (Ollama)** — run via Bash tool:
1. Read and extract identity sections (same as above)
2. Run:
```bash
ollama run {model} "{full prompt}" 2>/dev/null
```
3. Capture stdout. Timeout: 120 seconds (local models are slower).

**Fallback**: If any external provider call fails or times out, log `[FALLBACK] {member} failed on {provider}/{model}. Falling back to anthropic/{frontmatter_model}.` and re-run as a Claude subagent. Skip the failed provider for remaining rounds.

**Prompt template** (used for ALL providers — for external providers, inline the identity preamble):
```
You are operating as a council member in a structured deliberation.
{For subagent: "Read your agent definition at ~/.claude/agents/council-{name}.md and follow it precisely."}
{For external providers: paste the extracted Identity + Grounding Protocol + Output Format sections here}

The problem under deliberation:
{problem}

Here is how each member reframed the problem:
{all restatements from Step 1.5}

Produce your independent analysis using your Output Format (Standalone).
Do NOT try to anticipate what other members will say.
Limit: 400 words maximum.
```

**Note**: The same dispatch logic applies to all subsequent rounds (Steps 3 and 5). Use the routing table from Step 1 consistently. If a provider failed and fell back in an earlier round, use the fallback provider for all remaining rounds.

`[CHECKPOINT]` Confirm all Round 1 outputs collected. Verify each is ≤400 words and follows the member's Output Format.

### STEP 3: Round 2 — Cross-Examination (ANONYMIZED)

Emit to user:
> **Round 1 complete** ({N} analyses collected). Beginning Round 2 — cross-examination (anonymized).

**Identity anonymization** (evidence-based — see Choi et al., arXiv:2510.07517, ICLR 2026; Karpathy `llm-council`). Round 2 is conducted with member identities masked to prevent conformity bias from social signal. Before sending Round 2 prompts:

1. Build a stable label mapping for this session: `Member A` → first member, `Member B` → second, …, in the order they appear in the panel. The labels are stable across the entire Round 2 (and any Batch B follow-ups) so members can reference each other consistently within the round.
2. Rewrite each Round 1 output's header from `{name}` (or the member's self-attribution line) to its assigned label. Strip any in-body self-references that would re-disclose identity (e.g., "As Socrates, I…" → "As Member B, I…"). Keep all other content unchanged.
3. Retain the mapping privately in the coordinator's working state. **Do NOT** expose it to deliberating members during Round 2. The mapping is restored for Round 3 (Final Crystallization), tie-breaking, and the verdict transcript.

**Execution strategy:**
- If panel size ≤ 4: run fully **SEQUENTIAL** (each member sees all prior Round 2 responses, still with anonymized labels)
- If panel size ≥ 5: run all members in **PARALLEL** (each sees all anonymized Round 1 outputs). For panels of 7+, optionally use **Batch A** (parallel) + **Batch B** (sequential, sees Batch A outputs with the same labels) if cross-contamination would meaningfully improve quality.

Prompt template for each member:
```
You are council-{name} in Round 2 of a structured deliberation.
Read your agent definition at ~/.claude/agents/council-{name}.md.

**Identity is masked in this round.** The Round 1 analyses below are labeled
Member A, Member B, … — you do not know which colleague produced which. One
of them is your own Round 1 output (anonymized along with the rest). Evaluate
by argument quality, not by source. Do not try to guess identities and do not
reference any council member by their real name in this round; use the labels.

Here are the (anonymized) Round 1 analyses from all council members:

{anonymized Round 1 outputs, headed by Member A/B/C/…}

{If Batch B: "Here are Round 2 responses from earlier members (same labels):\n{Batch A Round 2 outputs}"}

Now respond using your Output Format (Council Round 2):
1. Which member's position do you most disagree with, and why? Engage their specific claims. Refer to them as "Member X".
2. Which member's insight strengthens your position? How? Refer to them as "Member Y".
3. Restate your position in light of this exchange, noting any changes.
4. Label your key claims: empirical | mechanistic | strategic | ethical | heuristic

Limit: 300 words maximum. You MUST engage at least 2 other members by label.
```

`[CHECKPOINT]` Confirm all Round 2 outputs collected. Before proceeding to STEP 4, the coordinator restores the label → real-name mapping in its working state. The Round 2 transcript is kept in BOTH forms: anonymized (what members saw) and de-anonymized (for STEP 7 audit).

### STEP 4: Post-Round Enforcement Scan

Run all enforcement checks on Round 2 outputs in a single pass:

**`[VERIFY]` Dissent quota**: At least 2 members must articulate a non-overlapping objection. If fewer than 2 → send the dissent prompt:
```
Your Round 2 response agreed with the emerging consensus. The council requires dissent for quality.
State your strongest objection to the majority position in 150 words. What are they getting wrong?
```

**`[VERIFY]` Novelty gate**: Each response must contain at least 1 new claim, test, risk, or reframing not in that member's Round 1 output. If missing → send back:
```
Your Round 2 response restated your Round 1 position without engaging the challenges raised.
Address {specific member}'s challenge to your position directly. What changes?
```

**`[VERIFY]` Agreement check**: If >70% agree on core position → trigger counterfactual prompt to 2 most likely dissenters:
```
Assume the current consensus is wrong. What is the strongest alternative and what evidence would flip the decision?
```

**`[VERIFY]` Evidence labels**: Confirm claims are tagged (`empirical | mechanistic | strategic | ethical | heuristic`). Note reasoning monoculture (>80% same type).

**`[VERIFY]` Anti-recursion**: Socrates re-asks an answered question → hemlock rule, force 50-word position. Any member restates Round 1 without engaging challenges → send back. Exchange exceeds 2 messages between any pair → cut off.

### STEP 5: Round 3 — Final Crystallization (PARALLEL)

Emit to user:
> **Cross-examination complete**. Round 3 — final positions.

Send each member their final prompt (run in parallel):
```
Final round. State your position declaratively in 100 words or less.
Socrates: you get exactly ONE question. Make it count. Then state your position.
No new arguments — only crystallization of your stance.
```

`[CHECKPOINT]` Confirm all Round 3 outputs collected.

### STEP 6: Tie-Breaking

- **2/3 majority** → consensus. Record dissenting position in Minority Report.
- **No majority** → present the dilemma to the user with each position clearly stated. Do NOT force consensus.
- **Domain expert weight**: The member whose domain most directly matches the problem gets 1.5x weight. (e.g., Ada for formal systems, Sun Tzu for competitive strategy)

### STEP 7: Synthesize Verdict

Produce the Council Verdict using the template below. This is the final deliverable.

---

## Quick Mode Sequence (`--quick`)

Fast 2-round deliberation for simpler questions. No cross-examination.

### QUICK STEP 0: Select Panel

Same panel selection as full mode Step 0. If no panel specified, default to best-matching triad via auto-selection.

`[CHECKPOINT]` State selected members.

### QUICK STEP 0.5: Problem Restate Gate

Each member restates the problem before analysis. In quick mode, this is embedded in the Round 1 prompt (not a separate step) to save time.

### QUICK STEP 1: Round 1 — Rapid Analysis (PARALLEL)

Emit to user:
> **Quick council convened**: {member names}. Rapid analysis.

Spawn all members in parallel with:
```
You are operating as a council member in a rapid deliberation.
Read your agent definition at ~/.claude/agents/council-{name}.md and follow it precisely.

The problem under deliberation:
{problem}

First, in ONE sentence, restate this problem through your analytical lens. Then produce a condensed analysis:
- Essential Question (1-2 sentences)
- Your core analysis (key insight only)
- Verdict (direct recommendation)
- Confidence (High/Medium/Low)

Limit: 200 words maximum. Be decisive.
```

`[CHECKPOINT]` Confirm all outputs collected.

### QUICK STEP 2: Round 2 — Final Positions (PARALLEL, ANONYMIZED)

Emit to user:
> **Round 1 complete**. Final positions (anonymized).

Anonymize peer Round 1 outputs the same way as STEP 3 of full mode: assign stable labels `Member A`, `Member B`, …, strip self-attribution, retain the mapping in coordinator state. Quick mode is more conformity-prone than full mode (only one cross-look), so anonymization here is non-optional.

Send each member:
```
Here are the (anonymized) Round 1 analyses from the other members:
{anonymized Round 1 outputs, headed by Member A/B/C/…}

**Identity is masked.** Evaluate by argument quality, not by source. Refer to
peers as "Member X" — do not use real council member names in this round.

State your final position in 75 words or less. Note any key disagreement
(call out the specific Member whose position you push back on). Be direct.
```

### QUICK STEP 3: Synthesize Quick Verdict

Use the Quick Verdict template below.

---

## Duo Mode Sequence (`--duo`)

Two-member dialectic for rapid opposing perspectives.

### DUO STEP 0: Select Pair

1. If `--members name1,name2` → use those two members
2. Otherwise → match problem against Duo Polarity Pairs table above, select the best-fitting pair
3. State the selected pair and the tension they represent

`[CHECKPOINT]` State selected pair and tension.

### DUO STEP 0.5: Problem Restate Gate

Each member restates the problem before analysis. In duo mode, this is embedded in the Round 1 prompt.

### DUO STEP 1: Round 1 — Opening Positions (PARALLEL)

Emit to user:
> **Duo convened**: {member A} vs {member B} — {tension description}.

Spawn both members in parallel:
```
You are operating as one half of a structured dialectic with one opponent.
Read your agent definition at ~/.claude/agents/council-{name}.md and follow it precisely.

The problem under deliberation:
{problem}

First, in ONE sentence, restate this problem through your analytical lens. Then state your position using your Output Format (Standalone).
Limit: 300 words maximum.
```

### DUO STEP 2: Round 2 — Direct Response (PARALLEL)

**Anonymization is not applied in duo mode.** With only two members and an explicitly named opponent, identity cannot be meaningfully masked (each side knows who the other is by elimination), and the dialectic depends on each member knowing their opponent's specific analytical lens. The conformity failure mode that motivates Round-2 anonymization in larger panels does not arise in a 2-member exchange.

Send each member the other's Round 1 output:
```
Your opponent ({other member name}) argued:

{other member's Round 1 output}

Respond directly:
1. Where are they wrong? Engage their specific claims.
2. Where are they right? Concede what deserves conceding.
3. Restate your position, strengthened by this exchange.

Limit: 200 words maximum.
```

### DUO STEP 3: Round 3 — Final Statements (PARALLEL)

```
Final statement. 50 words maximum. State your position. No new arguments.
```

### DUO STEP 4: Synthesize Duo Verdict

Use the Duo Verdict template below.

## Example Usage

**Full mode:**
`/council --triad strategy Should we open-source our agent framework?`
→ Convenes Sun Tzu + Machiavelli + Aurelius, runs 3-round deliberation, produces Council Verdict.

**Quick mode:**
`/council --quick Should we add Redis caching to the auth flow?`
→ Auto-selects architecture triad, runs 2-round rapid analysis, produces Quick Verdict.

**Duo mode:**
`/council --duo Should we rewrite the monolith as microservices?`
→ Selects Aristotle vs Lao Tzu (architecture domain), runs 3-round dialectic, produces Duo Verdict.

**Auto-triad:**
`/council What's the best pricing model for our API?`
→ Coordinator analyzes problem, selects `product` triad (Torvalds + Machiavelli + Watts), runs full deliberation.
